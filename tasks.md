# Detailed Reverse Proxy Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the step-by-step implementation of an HTTP reverse proxy in a low-level language (C, Zig, or C++). I'll use **curl** for testing throughout the process.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### Step 1: Project Structure and Basic Socket Server
**To-Do:**
[x] Set up project directory structure with source files and build configuration
[x] Implement basic TCP socket server that binds to a port (e.g., 8080)
[x] Add socket creation, binding, listening, and accepting connections
[x] Implement basic error handling for socket operations
[ ] Add graceful shutdown handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM)

**Test:**
```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8080
```
**Expected Result:** Connection should be established but may hang or return empty response (basic connectivity test)

### Step 2: HTTP Request Parsing
**To-Do:**
[x] Implement HTTP request line parsing (method, URI, version)
[x] Add HTTP header parsing functionality
[x] Handle request body reading for POST/PUT requests
[x] Add basic HTTP request validation
[x] Log parsed request details for debugging

**Test:**
```bash
curl -v -X GET http://localhost:8080/test -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Custom-Header: test"
```
**Expected Result:** Server should log the parsed method (GET), path (/test), and headers

### Step 3: Basic HTTP Response Generation
**To-Do:**
[ ] Implement HTTP response formatting (status line, headers, body)
[ ] Add functionality to send proper HTTP responses back to client
[ ] Create basic error responses (400, 404, 500)
[ ] Implement connection closing after response

**Test:**
```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8080/health
```
**Expected Result:** Should receive a proper HTTP response (even if it's just a 200 OK with basic body)

## Phase 2: Core Proxy Functionality

### Step 4: Backend Connection Management
**To-Do:**
[ ] Implement TCP client functionality to connect to backend servers
[ ] Add connection pooling or connection reuse logic
[ ] Handle backend connection failures and timeouts
[ ] Add configurable backend server addresses (hardcoded initially)

**Test:**
```bash
# Start a simple backend server (e.g., python -m http.server 8081)
curl -v http://localhost:8080/
```
**Expected Result:** Proxy should attempt to connect to backend (may fail, but connection attempts should be logged)

### Step 5: Request Forwarding
**To-Do:**
[ ] Forward original HTTP request to backend server
[ ] Preserve original request method, URI, and headers
[ ] Add proxy-specific headers (X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP)
[ ] Handle request body forwarding for POST/PUT requests
[ ] Implement timeout handling for backend requests

**Test:**
```bash
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/data -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test": "data"}'
```
**Expected Result:** Request should be forwarded to backend, and you should see the request in backend logs

### Step 6: Response Relaying
**To-Do:**
[ ] Read HTTP response from backend server
[ ] Parse backend response headers and status
[ ] Forward response headers to client (filtering proxy-specific ones)
[ ] Stream response body back to client
[ ] Handle chunked transfer encoding

**Test:**
```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8080/
```
**Expected Result:** Should receive the actual response from the backend server

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### Step 7: Multi-Backend Support and Load Balancing
**To-Do:**
[ ] Implement configuration file parsing for multiple backend servers
[ ] Add round-robin load balancing algorithm
[ ] Implement health checking for backend servers
[ ] Add fallback mechanisms for failed backends

**Test:**
```bash
# Make multiple requests to test load balancing
for i in {1..10}; do curl -s http://localhost:8080/ | grep "Server"; done
```
**Expected Result:** Requests should be distributed across multiple backend servers

### Step 8: Host-Based Routing
**To-Do:**
[ ] Parse Host header from incoming requests
[ ] Implement routing rules based on hostname
[ ] Add virtual host configuration support
[ ] Handle default backend for unmatched hosts

**Test:**
```bash
curl -v -H "Host: api.example.com" http://localhost:8080/
curl -v -H "Host: web.example.com" http://localhost:8080/
```
**Expected Result:** Different hosts should route to different backend servers

### Step 9: Advanced HTTP Features
**To-Do:**
[ ] Implement HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support
[ ] Add support for HTTP upgrade requests (WebSocket)
[ ] Handle HTTP compression (gzip) passthrough
[ ] Implement request/response header manipulation

**Test:**
```bash
curl -v -H "Connection: keep-alive" http://localhost:8080/
curl -v -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" http://localhost:8080/
```
**Expected Result:** Persistent connections should work, compressed responses should pass through

## Phase 4: Production Readiness

### Step 10: HTTPS/TLS Support
**To-Do:**
[ ] Integrate TLS library (OpenSSL or similar)
[ ] Implement SSL/TLS termination
[ ] Add certificate management
[ ] Support both HTTP and HTTPS frontends

**Test:**
```bash
curl -v -k https://localhost:8443/
```
**Expected Result:** HTTPS requests should be handled and forwarded to HTTP backends

### Step 11: Logging and Monitoring
**To-Do:**
[ ] Implement structured logging (access logs, error logs)
[ ] Add performance metrics collection
[ ] Implement request/response timing
[ ] Add configurable log levels and formats

**Test:**
```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8080/
# Check log files for proper access log entries
```
**Expected Result:** All requests should be logged with timing and status information

### Step 12: Performance Optimization
**To-Do:**
[ ] Implement non-blocking I/O (epoll on Linux, kqueue on BSD/macOS)
[ ] Add connection pooling to backends
[ ] Optimize memory allocation and buffer management
[ ] Add rate limiting capabilities

**Test:**
```bash
# Load testing
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/
```
**Expected Result:** Should handle concurrent requests efficiently without errors

## Phase 5: Configuration and Deployment

### Step 13: Configuration Management
**To-Do:**
[ ] Create comprehensive configuration file format (JSON/YAML)
[ ] Add runtime configuration reloading
[ ] Implement configuration validation
[ ] Add command-line argument parsing

**Test:**
```bash
# Test configuration reload
curl -v http://localhost:8080/config/reload
curl -v http://localhost:8080/
```
**Expected Result:** Configuration changes should take effect without restart

### Step 14: Final Integration Testing
**To-Do:**
[ ] Create comprehensive test suite
[ ] Test edge cases (malformed requests, network failures)
[ ] Performance benchmarking
[ ] Security testing (basic)

**Test:**
```bash
# Comprehensive testing
curl -v -X GET http://localhost:8080/
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/api -d '{"test": true}'
curl -v -H "Host: different.example.com" http://localhost:8080/
curl -v --max-time 1 http://localhost:8080/slow-endpoint
```
**Expected Result:** All tests should pass, proxy should handle various scenarios gracefully
